# **Data Science Internship**

## **Overview**

*This repository showcases my end-to-end work completed during my Data Analyst Internship. 
It includes real-world projects covering data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business insights.*

## **Internship**

#### 1. Data Immersion & Wrangling
    Objective:  To rapidly acquaint the intern with the provided dataset and master the critical
